Open these preview HTML files in a browser to get a quick, static visual of the theme colors.

Files:
- light-preview.html — a small code sample styled with the Crimson Red Light palette
- dark-preview.html  — code sample styled with the Crimson Red Dark palette

Notes:
- These previews are static and approximate: VS Code applies language grammars and exact tokenization which may vary from this simple HTML.
- To preview in VS Code: open the `preview` folder and open one of the .html files; VS Code's internal browser or an external browser will render it.

If you want, I can also generate a single side-by-side preview or export PNGs of each preview for quicker sharing.
